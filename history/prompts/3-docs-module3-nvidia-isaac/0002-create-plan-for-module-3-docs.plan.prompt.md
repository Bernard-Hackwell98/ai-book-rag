## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

I have generated the implementation plan and associated artifacts for Module 3. The branch is `003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac` and the plan file is located at `specs/003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/plan.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The implementation plan for Module 3 has been created.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/plan.md`
  - `specs/003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/research.md`
  - `specs/003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/data-model.md`
  - `specs/003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/quickstart.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The process was smooth after the initial file reading issues were resolved. The agent context update script worked as expected.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A

## Prompt

Title: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) Goal: Explain advanced perception, navigation, and training pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac for humanoid robots. Platform: Docusaurus (Markdown) Audience: Advanced students with AI, robotics, and simulation background Structure: Exactly 3 chapters. Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim - Photorealistic simulation - Synthetic data generation - Training perception models - Domain randomization Chapter 2: Isaac ROS - Hardware-accelerated perception - Visual SLAM (VSLAM) - Sensor pipelines - Performance optimization Chapter 3: Navigation and Planning - Nav2 architecture - Path planning for humanoids - Obstacle avoidance - Integration with perception stack Requirements: - Clean Markdown - Bullet points - No fluff

## Response snapshot

I have updated the specification for Module 3 and created the corresponding checklist. The branch is `003-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac` and the spec file is located at `specs/3-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/spec.md`. The specification is now ready for the next phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The specification for Module 3 has been updated to reflect the new requirements.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/3-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/spec.md`
  - `specs/3-docs-module3-nvidia-isaac/checklists/requirements.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of updating the spec was straightforward. The initial script failure was a minor setback, but was easily rectified. Manually creating the PHR was necessary due to the missing script.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A

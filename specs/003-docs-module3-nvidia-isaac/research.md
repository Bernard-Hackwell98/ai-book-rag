## Node.js Version for Docusaurus v3

**Decision**: Use Node.js v20.0 or above.

**Rationale**: Docusaurus v3 requires Node.js v20.0 or above, as confirmed by the official documentation and search results. This ensures compatibility with the latest features and security updates.

**Alternatives considered**: Using an older version of Node.js was not considered as it would be incompatible with the project's dependency, Docusaurus v3.

# Data Model: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This feature is focused on documentation and does not have a traditional data model with persistent entities. The key concepts and technologies discussed in this module are:

-   **Module 3**: The documentation module for "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)". It contains three chapters that cover NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Navigation for humanoid robots.

-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A photorealistic simulation platform used for developing, testing, and training AI-based robots. Key features covered include synthetic data generation and domain randomization.

-   **Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for robotic perception. It includes features like Visual SLAM (VSLAM) and sensor pipeline optimization.

-   **Nav2**: The navigation stack used for path planning and obstacle avoidance in robotics. The documentation will cover its architecture and application to humanoid robots.

-   **Humanoid Robot**: The target robotic platform for the concepts discussed in this module. The documentation will address the specific challenges of navigation and planning for bipedal robots.

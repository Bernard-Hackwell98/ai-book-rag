# Research: Docusaurus Site

**Decision**: Use Docusaurus for the documentation website.
**Rationale**: Docusaurus is the specified tool in the project constitution and is well-suited for building documentation sites with Markdown. It integrates with React and provides features like versioning, search, and theming out of the box.
**Alternatives considered**: None, as Docusaurus is the mandated tool.

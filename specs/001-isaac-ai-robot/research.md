**Date**: 2025-12-24
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Research Tasks

This phase focuses on gathering information to ensure the documentation content is accurate, clear, and suitable for the target audience.

### Task 1: Documentation Best Practices for Advanced AI/Robotics Concepts in Docusaurus

**Research Goal**: To identify best practices for explaining complex AI and robotics concepts in Docusaurus Markdown for an advanced student audience, ensuring clarity, conceptual depth, and adherence to "no fluff" and "bullet points" constraints.

**Decision**: Focus on conceptual explanations of core functionalities and high-level architecture, avoiding implementation details and code snippets, as per the resolved clarification.
**Rationale**: This approach aligns with the audience's background (advanced students) and the "no fluff" constraint, prioritizing understanding of *what* and *why* over *how*.
**Alternatives considered**: Providing in-depth algorithmic details or code examples were rejected to maintain conceptual clarity and avoid implementation focus.

### Task 2: NVIDIA Isaac Sim for Perception and Data Generation

**Research Goal**: To understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim's capabilities for photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and perception model training, focusing on conceptual explanations suitable for advanced students.

**Decision**: Document Isaac Sim's role in simulation, synthetic data generation, and training, emphasizing its conceptual contribution to perception models and domain randomization.
**Rationale**: This directly addresses Chapter 1 requirements and the feature's goal of explaining advanced pipelines.
**Alternatives considered**: Detailed technical specifications of Isaac Sim features were deemed too implementation-focused.

### Task 3: Isaac ROS for Hardware-Accelerated Perception and VSLAM

**Research Goal**: To understand Isaac ROS's role in hardware-accelerated perception, VSLAM, and sensor pipeline optimization, focusing on conceptual explanations for advanced students.

**Decision**: Explain Isaac ROS's contribution to perception acceleration, VSLAM conceptual overview, and sensor pipeline optimization.
**Rationale**: This fulfills the requirements for Chapter 2 and aligns with the feature's goal of explaining advanced pipelines.
**Alternatives considered**: Deep dives into specific ROS 2 message types or C++ implementations were rejected to maintain a conceptual, high-level explanation.

### Task 4: Nav2 Architecture for Humanoid Robot Navigation and Planning

**Research Goal**: To understand the Nav2 architecture for path planning and obstacle avoidance in humanoid robots, and its integration with perception stacks, focusing on conceptual explanations for advanced students.

**Decision**: Detail the Nav2 architecture's role in path planning, obstacle avoidance, and its conceptual integration with perception for humanoid robots.
**Rationale**: This directly addresses the requirements for Chapter 3 and the feature's overall goal.
**Alternatives considered**: Detailed descriptions of specific Nav2 algorithms or ROS 2 navigation stack components were excluded to maintain a conceptual focus.

# No API Contracts Required

This feature is focused on creating documentation content for "Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)". As such, it does not involve the development of any APIs or services that would require formal API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas).

The "contracts" for this feature are implicitly defined by the structure and content standards outlined in the `spec.md` and `data-model.md` files, which govern how the documentation is organized and presented.

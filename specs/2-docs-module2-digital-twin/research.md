# Research for Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Documentation

## Phase 0: Outline & Research Findings

### 1. Docusaurus Best Practices for Multi-Chapter Tutorials

**Decision**:
We will leverage Docusaurus's file-based routing and sidebar configuration to structure the three chapters of the "Digital Twin" module. Content will be organized into subfolders within `docs/module2/`, with each subfolder representing a chapter and containing Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files for individual pages. `_category_.json` files will be used within each chapter folder to manage metadata like labels and positions in the sidebar. We will utilize the manual sidebar configuration in `sidebars.js` for precise control over chapter and page order. We will also consider using MDX for embedding interactive elements if beneficial for explaining complex simulation concepts.

**Rationale**:
Docusaurus is well-suited for structured, multi-chapter technical documentation. Its features simplify navigation, content organization, and ensure a consistent user experience. Using manual sidebar configuration provides fine-grained control necessary for a structured tutorial. MDX offers flexibility to enhance learning with interactive components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
*   **Autogenerated sidebars**: Rejected because manual control is preferred for a fixed, tutorial-style structure with specific chapter ordering.
*   **Single-page documentation**: Rejected as it would lead to an overwhelming user experience for a multi-chapter module.
*   **External documentation platforms**: Rejected due to the existing Docusaurus setup and the desire for integrated documentation.

### 2. Conventions for Documenting Simulation Software (Gazebo & Unity)

**Decision**:
The documentation for "Module 2 – The Digital Twin" will adhere to general documentation principles (clarity, conciseness, accuracy, currency, accessibility). While this module is *about* documenting, not *in-code* documentation of Gazebo/Unity itself, the content will reflect these principles by:
*   **Clarity and Conciseness**: Avoiding jargon where possible, providing clear explanations, and extensive use of bullet points as specified in the feature requirements.
*   **Accuracy and Currency**: Ensuring technical details regarding Gazebo, Unity, and ROS 2 are current and verifiable.
*   **User-focused**: Presenting information in a tutorial format, including steps for setup, configuration, and practical application (e.g., how to simulate a sensor).
*   **Illustrations**: Utilizing diagrams or screenshots (where appropriate and feasible to generate within Docusaurus) to clarify complex concepts or user interface interactions.
*   **Methodology and Assumptions**: Explicitly stating the methodology for setting up simulations and any underlying assumptions (e.g., software versions, hardware requirements) within the tutorial content.
*   **Installation/Setup**: Including clear instructions or references to installation guides for relevant software, even if not re-iterating full installation steps.

**Rationale**:
Effective documentation for simulation software requires a focus on practical application and clarity for the end-user (advanced students). Adhering to these conventions will make the tutorial valuable and actionable. The feature itself is about creating this documentation, so reflecting these principles in the content itself is key.

**Alternatives Considered**:
*   **Overly academic/theoretical approach**: Rejected in favor of a more hands-on, tutorial-driven style suitable for advanced students.
*   **Minimalist documentation**: Rejected as it would not provide the comprehensive detail required for understanding complex simulation environments.
*   **Focusing solely on code-level documentation conventions**: While important for software development, this module is about teaching *how to use* Gazebo/Unity for digital twins, so user-level documentation conventions are more pertinent.

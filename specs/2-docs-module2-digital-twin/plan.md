# Implementation Plan: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Branch**: `2-docs-module2-digital-twin` | **Date**: 2025-12-24 | **Spec**: [specs/2-docs-module2-digital-twin/spec.md](specs/2-docs-module2-digital-twin/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/2-docs-module2-digital-twin/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation for creating comprehensive documentation for physics-based simulation and digital twin creation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. The documentation will be structured into three chapters and published on a Docusaurus platform, targeting advanced students with ROS 2 and simulation experience. The technical approach involves leveraging Docusaurus features for clear, concise, and modular content delivery.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (Node.js v20+), Markdown/MDX (for Docusaurus), HTML/CSS (for presentation)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3, React v18, potentially specific Docusaurus plugins for code highlighting, diagrams, etc.
**Storage**: Markdown files on the filesystem, managed by Docusaurus.
**Testing**: Docusaurus's built-in build process for broken links and Markdown errors, manual review for content accuracy and clarity.
**Target Platform**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus, deployable on any web server)
**Project Type**: Documentation (within an existing Docusaurus site)
**Performance Goals**: Fast page load times (inherent to Docusaurus static site generation), efficient search within documentation.
**Constraints**: Adherence to existing Docusaurus theme and styling; content must be easily digestible for an advanced student audience.
**Scale/Scope**: Three chapters, comprehensive coverage of Gazebo physics, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

-   **I. Spec-Driven Development**: ✅ This plan is directly derived from the `2-docs-module2-digital-twin` specification.
-   **II. Technical Accuracy**: ✅ The plan includes tasks to research best practices for documenting technical content and simulation software, ensuring accuracy.
-   **III. Modular Architecture**: ✅ The documentation is structured into distinct chapters, promoting modularity. The Docusaurus framework itself promotes modularity through its content management.
-   **IV. Standardized Tooling**: ✅ The plan adheres to the approved stack: Docusaurus (Node.js, React, Markdown). No deviations are proposed.
-   **V. Reproducible Output**: ✅ The plan includes creating a `quickstart.md` for contributors, detailing setup and contribution guidelines, ensuring reproducibility of the documentation.

### Source Code (repository root)

# Documentation content will reside in the 'docs' directory of the main project.

```

**Structure Decision**: The documentation content for this feature will be integrated directly into the existing Docusaurus `docs/docs/module2/` directory, following the established content structure for modules. This leverages the existing `docs` (Docusaurus project) which handles the overall static site generation.
